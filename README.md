## Acceptance Criteria

```md
On a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer when I load the portfolio

 I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio when I view the header

I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted when I view the navigation titles

I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted when I click on a navigation title

the About Me title and section are selected by default when I load the portfolio the first time

I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them when I am presented with the About Me section

I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories when I am presented with the Portfolio section

I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message when I am presented with the Contact section

I receive a notification that this field is required when I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text

I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address when I enter text into the email address field

I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies when I am presented with the Resume section

I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter) when I view the footer
