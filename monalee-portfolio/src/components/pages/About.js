    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>
    I am a 30 year old Thai-Indian born and raised in Bangkok, then spent a handful of my adult years
    traveling the world as an international flight attendant based in Dubai, but after reassessing
    my goals I made a career/life change and moved to southern California almost two years ago. 
    I have been self-studying computer programming as well as working as a Data analyst. Now I am 
    enrolled in UCI full stack bootcamp, gaining more programming skills preparing myself to be 
    ready to enter the tech world.
